abstract = {{A frequency‐diverse computational imaging system synthesised using three‐dimensional (3D) printed frequency‐diverse metasurface antennas is demonstrated. The 3D fabrication of the antennas is achieved using a combination of polylactic acid (PLA) polymer material and conductive polymer material (Electrifi), circumventing the requirement for expensive and time‐consuming conventional fabrication techniques, such as machine milling, photolithography, and laser‐etching. Using the 3D printed frequency‐diverse metasurface antennas, a composite aperture is designed and simulated for imaging in the K‐band frequency regime (17.5–26.5 GHz). The frequency‐diverse system is capable of imaging by means of a simple frequency‐sweep in an all‐electronic manner, avoiding mechanical scanning and active circuit components. Using the synthesised system, microwave imaging of objects is achieved at the diffraction limit. It is also demonstrated that the conductivity of the Electrifi polymer material significantly affects the performance of the 3D printed antennas and therefore is a critical factor governing the fidelity of the reconstructed images.}},

abstract = {{ This work examines the use of dual-material fused filament fabrication for 3D printing electronic components and circuits with conductive thermoplastic filaments. The resistivity of traces printed from conductive thermoplastic filaments made with carbon-black, graphene, and copper as conductive fillers was found to be 12, 0.78, and 0.014Ωcm, respectively, enabling the creation of resistors with values spanning 3 orders of magnitude. The carbon black and graphene filaments were brittle and fractured easily, but the copper-based filament could be bent at least 500 times with little change in its resistance. Impedance measurements made on the thermoplastic filaments demonstrate that the copper-based filament had an impedance similar to a copper PCB trace at frequencies greater than 1MHz. Dual material 3D printing was used to fabricate a variety of inductors and capacitors with properties that could be predictably tuned by modifying either the geometry of the components, or the materials used to fabricate the components. These resistors, capacitors, and inductors were combined to create a fully 3D printed high-pass filter with properties comparable to its conventional counterparts. The relatively low impedance of the copper-based filament enabled its use for 3D printing of a receiver coil for wireless power transfer. We also demonstrate the ability to embed and connect surface mounted components in 3D printed objects with a low-cost (\$1000 in parts), open source dual-material 3D printer. This work thus demonstrates the potential for FFF 3D printing to create complex, three-dimensional circuits composed of either embedded or fully-printed electronic components.}},

  abstract = {The ARIANNA hexagonal radio array (HRA) is an experiment in its pilot phase designed to detect cosmogenic neutrinos of energies above 10^16 eV. The most neutrino-like background stems from the radio emission of air showers. This article reports on dedicated efforts of simulating and detecting the signals of cosmic rays. A description of the fully radio self-triggered data-set, the properties of the detected air shower signals in the frequency range of \unit[100-500]{MHz} and the consequences for neutrino detection are given. 38 air shower signals are identified by their distinct waveform characteristics, are in good agreement with simulations and their signals provide evidence that neutrino-induced radio signals will be distinguishable with high efficiency in ARIANNA. The cosmic ray flux at a mean energy of $6.5^{+1.2}_{-1.0}\times10^{17}$ eV is measured to be $1.1^{+1.0}_{-0.7}\times10^{-16}$ eV$^{-1}$km$^{-2}$sr$^{-1}$yr$^{-1}$ and one five-fold coincident event is used to illustrate the capabilities of the ARIANNA detector to reconstruct arrival direction and energy of air showers.}

  abstract = {Neutrinos are key to probing the deep structure of matter and the high-energy Universe. Yet, until recently, their interactions had only been measured at laboratory energies up to about 350 GeV. An opportunity to measure their interactions at higher energies opened up with the detection of high-energy neutrinos in IceCube, partially of astrophysical origin. Scattering off matter inside the Earth affects the distribution of their arrival directions --- from this, we extract the neutrino-nucleon cross section at energies from 18 TeV to 2 PeV, in four energy bins, in spite of uncertainties in the neutrino flux. Using six years of public IceCube High-Energy Starting Events, we explicitly show for the first time that the energy dependence of the cross section above 18 TeV agrees with the predicted softer-than-linear dependence, and reaffirm the absence of new physics that would make the cross section rise sharply, up to a center-of-mass energy of ~1 TeV.},

We also present the associated uncertainties propagated from the PDFs, as well as parametrizations of the cross section central values, their uncertainty bounds, and the inelasticity distributions for ease of use in Monte Carlo simulations. For the latter we only provide parametrizations for energies above 107 GeV. Finally, we assess the feasibility of future neutrino experiments to constrain the νN cross section in the ultrahigh energy regime using a technique that is independent of the flux spectrum of incident neutrinos. A significant deviation from the predicted standard model cross sections could be an indication of new physics, such as extra space-time dimensions, and we present expected constraints on such models as a function of the number of events observed in a future subterranean neutrino detector.}

  abstract = {We present 88 multi-epoch Very Long Baseline Array (VLBA) images (most at an observing frequency of 8 GHz), of 20 TeV blazars, all of the HBL class, that have not been previously studied at multiple epochs on the parsec scale. From these 20 sources, we analyze the apparent speeds of 43 jet components that are all detected at four or more epochs. As has been found for other TeV HBLs, the apparent speeds of these components are relatively slow. About two-thirds of the components have an apparent speed that is consistent (within two-sigma) with no motion; and some of these components may be stationary patterns whose apparent speed does not relate to the underlying bulk flow speed. In addition, a superluminal tail to the apparent speed distribution of the TeV HBLs is detected for the first time, with eight components in seven sources having a two-sigma lower limit on the apparent speed exceeding 1c. We combine the data from these 20 sources with an additional 18 sources from the literature to analyze the complete apparent speed distribution of all 38 TeV HBLs that have been studied with VLBI at multiple epochs. The highest two-sigma apparent speed lower limit considering all sources is 3.6c. This suggests that bulk Lorentz factors of up to about 4, but probably not much higher, exist in the parsec-scale radio emitting regions of these sources, consistent with estimates obtained in the radio by other means such as brightness temperatures. This can be reconciled with the high Lorentz factors estimated from the high-energy data if the jet has velocity structures consisting of different emission regions with different Lorentz factors. In particular, we analyze the current apparent speed data for the TeV HBLs in the context of a model with a fast central spine and a slower outer layer.}

ABSTRACT = {Phased array radar systems have a wide variety of applications in engineering and physics research. Phased array design usually requires numerical modeling with expensive commercial computational packages. Using the open-source MIT Electrogmagnetic Equation Propagation (MEEP) package, a set of phased array designs is presented. Specifically, one and two-dimensional arrays of Yagi-Uda and horn antennas were modeled in the bandwidth [0.1–5] GHz, and compared to theoretical expectations in the far-field. Precise matches between MEEP simulation and radiation pattern predictions at different frequencies and beam angles are demonstrated. Given that the computations match the theory, the effect of embedding a phased array within a medium of varying index of refraction is then computed. Understanding the effect of varying index on phased arrays is critical for proposed ultra-high energy neutrino observatories which rely on phased array detectors embedded in natural ice. Future work will develop the phased array concepts with parallel MEEP, in order to increase the detail, complexity, and speed of the computations.},

	journal = {The Astrophysical Journal},
	abstract = {Evidence for an extraterrestrial flux of high-energy neutrinos has now been found in multiple searches with the IceCube detector. The first solid evidence was provided by a search for neutrino events with deposited energies  TeV and interaction vertices inside the instrumented volume. Recent analyses suggest that the extraterrestrial flux extends to lower energies and is also visible with throughgoing, νμ-induced tracks from the Northern Hemisphere. Here, we combine the results from six different IceCube searches for astrophysical neutrinos in a maximum-likelihood analysis. The combined event sample features high-statistics samples of shower-like and track-like events. The data are fit in up to three observables: energy, zenith angle, and event topology. Assuming the astrophysical neutrino flux to be isotropic and to consist of equal flavors at Earth, the all-flavor spectrum with neutrino energies between 25 TeV and 2.8 PeV is well described by an unbroken power law with best-fit spectral index −2.50 ± 0.09 and a flux at 100 TeV of . Under the same assumptions, an unbroken power law with index −2 is disfavored with a significance of 3.8σ (p = 0.0066%) with respect to the best fit. This significance is reduced to 2.1σ (p = 1.7%) if instead we compare the best fit to a spectrum with index −2 that has an exponential cut-off at high energies. Allowing the electron-neutrino flux to deviate from the other two flavors, we find a νe fraction of 0.18 ± 0.11 at Earth. The sole production of electron neutrinos, which would be characteristic of neutron-decay-dominated sources, is rejected with a significance of 3.6σ (p = 0.014%).}

These calculations, and the associated open-source code, allow the user to avoid computationally intensive Monte Carlo cascade simulations. Searches for cosmogenic neutrinos in Askaryan-based detectors benefit from computational speed, because scans of Askaryan parameter-space are required to match neutrino signals. The Askaryan field is derived from cascade equations verified with Geant4 simulations, and compared with prior numerical and semi-analytic calculations. Finally, instructive cases of the model are transformed from the Fourier domain to the time-domain.

This allows for a unique identification of neutrinos against backgrounds arriving from above. Furthermore, the time delay between the direct and reflected signal (D'n'R) correlates with the distance to the neutrino interaction vertex, a crucial quantity to determine the neutrino energy. In a simulation study, we derive the relation between time delay and distance and study the corresponding experimental uncertainties in estimating neutrino energies. We find that the resulting contribution to the energy resolution is well below the natural limit set by the unknown inelasticity in the initial neutrino interaction. We present an in-situ measurement that proves the experimental feasibility of this technique. Continuous monitoring of the local snow accumulation in the vicinity of the transmit and receive antennas using this technique provide a precision of \$\textbackslashmathcal\{O\}\$(1 mm) in surface elevation, which is much better than that needed to apply the D'n'R technique to neutrinos.}},

UHE neutrinos may provide important clues to understanding the nature of cosmic-ray sources. ARIANNA aims to detect UHE neutrinos via radio (Askaryan) emission from particle showers when a neutrino interacts with ice, which is an efficient method for neutrinos with energies between 10\textasciicircum16 eV and 10\textasciicircum20 eV. The ARIANNA radio detectors are located in Antarctic ice just beneath the surface. Neutrino observation requires that radio pulses propagate to the antennas at the surface with minimum distortion by the ice and firn medium. Using the residual hole from the South Pole Ice Core Project, radio pulses were emitted from a transmitter located up to 1.7 km below the snow surface. By measuring these signals with an ARIANNA surface station, the angular and polarization reconstruction abilities are quantified, which are required to measure the direction of the neutrino. After deconvolving the raw signals for the detector response and attenuation from propagation through the ice, the signal pulses show no significant distortion and agree with a reference measurement of the emitter made in an anechoic chamber. Furthermore, the signal pulses reveal no significant birefringence for our tested geometry of mostly vertical ice propagation. The origin of the transmitted radio pulse was measured with an angular resolution of 0.37 degrees indicating that the neutrino direction can be determined with good precision if the polarization of the radio-pulse can be well determined. In the present study we obtained a resolution of the polarization vector of 2.7 degrees. Neither measurement show a significant offset relative to expectation.}},

A description of the fully radio self-triggered data-set, the properties of the detected air shower signals in the frequency range of 100–500 MHz and the consequences for neutrino detection are given. 38 air shower signals are identified by their distinct waveform characteristics, are in good agreement with simulations and their signals provide evidence that neutrino-induced radio signals will be distinguishable with high efficiency in ARIANNA. The cosmic ray flux at a mean energy of 6.5−1.0+1.2×1017 eV is measured to be 1.1−0.7+1.0×10−16 eV−1 km−2 sr−1 yr−1 and one five-fold coincident event is used to illustrate the capabilities of the ARIANNA detector to reconstruct arrival direction and energy of air showers.}},

ARIANNA uses Create CLP5130-2N log-periodic dipole arrays (LPDAs). The associated effective height operator converts incident electric fields to voltage waveforms at the LDPA terminals. The effective height versus time and incident angle was measured, along with the associated response of the ARIANNA RF amplifier.

PE methods provide an approximate solution to Maxwell's equations, in contrast to full-field solutions such as finite-difference-time-domain (FDTD) methods, yet provide a more complete model of propagation than simple geometric ray-tracing (RT) methods that are the current state of the art for simulating in-ice radio detection of neutrino-induced cascades. PE are more computationally efficient than FDTD methods, and more flexible than RT methods, allowing for the inclusion of diffractive effects, and modeling of propagation in regions that cannot be modeled with geometric methods. We present a new PE approximation suited to the in-ice case. We conclude that current ray-tracing methods may be too simplistic in their treatment of ice properties, and their continued use could overestimate experimental sensitivity for in-ice neutrino detection experiments. We discuss the implications for current in-ice Askaryan-type detectors and for the upcoming Radar Echo Telescope; two families of experiments for which these results are most relevant.

At the same time, in the academic world, it is frequent to develop in-house simulation software, even from scratch and without proper knowledge of the existing possibilities. The rationale of the present paper is to review, from a practical viewpoint, the open-source software that can be useful in the antenna design process. To this end, an introductory overview of the usual design workflow is firstly presented. Subsequently, the strengths and weaknesses of open-source software compared to its commercial counterpart are analyzed. After that, the main open-source packages that are currently available online are briefly described. The last part of this paper is devoted to a preliminary numerical benchmark for the assessment of the capabilities and limitations of a subset of the presented open-source programs. The benchmark includes the calculation of some fundamental antenna parameters for four different typologies of radiating elements.}},

In the context of astroparticle physics experiments aimed at understanding radio emissions from cosmic rays interacting in the Earth's polar regions, our goals for this study were twofold: (1) identify radio frequency wave speed polarization asymmetries in Antarctica and (for the first time) in Greenland and (2) directly extract the depth dependence of the radio frequency field attenuation length as well as map out the attenuation over a large area. We first examine asymmetries in the real part of the permittivity (index‐of‐refraction ) using Center for Remote Sensing of Ice Sheets bedrock radar reflection data taken from a single location, but with different signal polarizations. These data indicate birefringence for flow parallel‐, versus perpendicular‐to the local ice‐flow direction, with the former corresponding to smaller index‐of‐refraction (i.e., faster wave speed). Second, we have investigated the imaginary part of the permittivity ( ) and extracted the depth dependence of the field attenuation length ( ), as well as estimated the depth‐averaged radio frequency attenuation length from data taken near the Greenland Ice Core Project site near Summit, Greenland. We obtain m based on calculated values in the 1000–2000 m ice depth interval to which we have sensitivity and extrapolated to the full depth, where the errors shown reflect our uncertainty in our extrapolation. We also observe the expected decrease in attenuation length with increasing depth/temperature. A depth‐averaged attenuation length is also extracted directly from the relative strengths of the observed bedrock versus surface returns over large regions of both Greenland and Antarctica. Apparent radio frequency birefringent asymmetry is observed in polar ice CReSIS data can possibly be used to estimate depth‐dependent attenuation of polar ice near GRIP The expanse of the CReSIS data set might be used to generalize points \#1 and \#2 to other polar ice}},

abstract = {{Using the IceCube Neutrino Observatory, we search for high-energy neutrino emission coincident with compact binary mergers observed by the LIGO and Virgo gravitational wave (GW) detectors during their first and second observing runs. We present results from two searches targeting emission coincident with the sky localization of each gravitational wave event within a 1000 second time window centered around the reported merger time. One search uses a model-independent unbinned maximum likelihood analysis, which uses neutrino data from IceCube to search for point-like neutrino sources consistent with the sky localization of GW events. The other uses the Low-Latency Algorithm for Multi-messenger Astrophysics, which incorporates astrophysical priors through a Bayesian framework and includes LIGO-Virgo detector characteristics to determine the association between the GW source and the neutrinos. No significant neutrino coincidence is seen by either search during the first two observing runs of the LIGO-Virgo detectors. We set upper limits on the time-integrated neutrino emission within the 1000 second window for each of the 11 GW events. These limits range from 0.02-0.7 \$\textbackslashmathrm\{GeV\textbackslashtextasciitildecm\textasciicircum\{-2\}\}\$. We also set limits on the total isotropic equivalent energy, \$E\_\{\textbackslashmathrm\{iso\}\}\$, emitted in high-energy neutrinos by each GW event. These limits range from 1.7 \$\textbackslashtimes\$ 10\$\textasciicircum\{51\}\$ - 1.8 \$\textbackslashtimes\$ 10\$\textasciicircum\{55\}\$ erg. We conclude with an outlook for LIGO-Virgo observing run O3, during which both analyses are running in real time.}},

abstract = {{The production of ultrahigh energy photons, electrons and neutrinos as the decay products of pions produced in photomeson interactions between cosmic-ray nucleons and the blackbody microwave background is discussed in terms of the resultant energy spectra of these particles. Simple asymptotic formulas are given for calculating the ultrahigh energy photon spectrum predicted for the universal cosmic-ray hypothesis and the resulting spectra are compared with those obtained previously by numerical means using a different propagation equation for the photons. Approximate analytic solutions for the photon spectra are given in terms of simple power-law energy functions and slowly varying logarithmic functions. These can be used to estimate ultrahigh energy photon fluxes for various astrophysical parameters. The generic relation between the various secondary components is then discussed in terms of their astrophysical implications which are summarized in the conclusion.}},

abstract = {{The miniaturized high-gain antenna is required in portable, ultra-wideband radar systems. However, the miniaturization, ultra-wideband and high gain often restrict each other in the antenna design. In this paper, a dual-polarized, double-slot, antipodal tapered slot antenna with a double-layer, dual-loop structure and novel slot edges is presented. The proposed magnetic dual-loop structure has the capacity to reduce the low cut-off frequency of the double-slot tapered slot antenna by weakening the resonance and coupling. In addition, the high gain, low sidelobe level (SLL), and low cross-polarization level are achieved in the boresight direction. A novel gradient slot profile is designed to improve the low-frequency directivity of the tapered slot antenna without affecting the matching. To feed the antenna elements, a kind of wideband, balun-divider structure is designed. The dual-polarized antenna is combined by two orthogonal elements in a cross configuration without galvanic contact or influence to performance. The measured results show that the impedance bandwidth of the proposed antenna is 0.6\textbackslashtextasciitilde4 GHz, and the maximum gain is 11 dBi. The isolation between the two antenna ports is better than 32 dB, and the cross-polarization discrimination (XPD) is better than 20 dB.}},

First, a wideband characterization was conducted, printing a microstrip transmission line using a conductive filament with variations of typical 3D-printing settings, such as layer height, infill percentage, and infill pattern. The measurement results show a dependence on the high-frequency transmission parameters with respect to the infill percentage and the infill pattern. Finally, two antennas were 3D-printed using conductive material, a microstrip patch, and a low-weight pyramidal horn antenna. The results for the patch agree with the losses found on the line measurements, while the low-weight pyramidal horn exhibits no major differences compared with its equivalent antenna, made using perfect conductors.}},
